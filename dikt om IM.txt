In the realm of Information, bright and vast,
Where bits and bytes in harmony amass,
Technology weaves its intricate threads,
A tapestry of knowledge, where knowledge spreads.

In silicon cities, circuits come alive,
As data streams in ones and zeros strive,
To bridge the gaps in space and in time,
Connecting hearts, in a digital rhyme.

Media production, a symphony of art,
From pixels to sound, it's a craft so smart,
Cameras roll, capturing every sight,
In pixels and frames, in the softest light.

Video editors weave stories with care,
Sound engineers craft the songs we share,
Graphic designers paint the visual dream,
In this digital world, where ideas gleam.

From web design to 3D animation's grace,
Information technology finds its place,
Empowering creators with tools so vast,
To shape the future and make moments last.

In the binary dance, ones and zeroes sway,
Creating the magic in a digital ballet,
From streaming platforms to the internet's sea,
Information technology sets minds free.

So let us celebrate this fusion divine,
Where data and art in harmony shine,
Information technology and media's art,
Together they shape the world's beating heart.
